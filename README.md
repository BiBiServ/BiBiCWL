# BiBiCWL
BiBiCWL is a tool for converting BiBiApps (BiBiServ applications) into CWL Command Line Tools.

## compiling the project

The project can be compiled using Gradle.

```
gradle build
```

The two executable gradlew and gradlew.bat which are shipped with the project can be used if Gradle is not installed on the system. (I did not test this on other systems.)

An artifact of the project will be placed in the build/libs/ directory.
